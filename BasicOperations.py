import numpy as np
a=np.array([1,2,3])
b=np.array([4,5,6])
#Now I will try some basic operations on them
print("Addition : ",a+b)
print("Multiplication : ",a*b)
print("Dot product : ",np.dot(a,b))
#a and b both are matrix. Now they will follow every rule of matrix for these operations
#Just like we did in matrix. These are 1d arrays
